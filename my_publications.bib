  abstract = {The increasing use of private vehicles for transportation in cities results in a growing demand for parking space and road network capacity. In many densely populated urban areas, however, the capacity of existing infrastructure is insufficient and extremely difficult to expand. Mobility-on-demand systems have been proposed as a remedy to the problem of limited parking space because they are able to satisfy the existing transportation demand with fewer shared vehicles and consequently require less parking space. Yet, the impact of large-scale vehicle sharing on traffic patterns is not well understood. In this work, we perform a simulation-based analysis of consequences of a hypothetical deployment of a large-scale station-based mobility-on-demand system in Prague and measure the traffic intensity generated by the system and its effects on the formation of congestion. We find that such a mobility-on-demand system would lead to significantly increased total driven distance and it would also increase levels of congestion due to extra trips without passengers. In fact, 38\% kilometers traveled in such an MoD system would be driven empty.},

  abstract = {In densely populated-cities, the use of private cars for personal transportation is unsustainable, due to high parking and road capacity requirements. The mobility-on-demand systems have been proposed as an alternative to a private car. Such systems consist of a fleet of vehicles that the user of the system can hail for one-way point-to-point trips. These systems employ large-scale vehicle sharing, i.e., one vehicle can be used by several people during one day and consequently, the fleet size and the parking space requirements can be reduced, but, at the cost of a non-negligible increase in vehicles miles driven in the system. The miles driven in the system can be reduced by ridesharing, where several people traveling in a similar direction are matched and travel in one vehicle. We quantify the potential of ridesharing in a hypothetical mobility-on-demand system designed to serve all trips that are currently realized by private car in the city of Prague. Our results show that by employing a ridesharing strategy that guarantees travel time prolongation of no more than 10 minutes, the average occupancy of a vehicle will increase to 2.7 passengers. Consequently, the number of vehicle miles traveled will decrease to 35\% of the amount in the MoD system without ridesharing and to 60\% of the amount in the present state.},

  abstract = {Mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems consist of a fleet of shared vehicles that can be hailed for one-way point-to-point trips. The total distance driven by the vehicles and the fleet size can be reduced by employing ridesharing, i.e., by assigning multiple passengers to one vehicle. However, finding the optimal passenger-vehicle assignment in an MoD system is a hard combinatorial problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the VGA method, a recently proposed systematic method for ridesharing, can be used to compute the optimal passenger-vehicle assignments and corresponding vehicle routes in a massive-scale MoD system. In contrast to existing works, we solve all passenger-vehicle assignment problems to optimality, regularly dealing with instances containing thousands of vehicles and passengers. Moreover, to examine the impact of using optimal ridesharing assignments, we compare the performance of an MoD system that uses optimal assignments against an MoD system that uses assignments computed using insertion heuristic and against an MoD system that uses no ridesharing. We found that the system that uses optimal ridesharing assignments subject to the maximum travel delay of 4 minutes reduces the vehicle distance driven by 57\% compared to an MoD system without ridesharing. Furthermore, we found that the optimal assignments result in a 20\% reduction in vehicle distance driven and 5\% lower average passenger travel delay compared to a system that uses insertion heuristic.},

  abstract = {GPS receivers embedded in cell phones and connected vehicles generate a series of location measurements that can be used for various analytical purposes. A common pre-processing step of this data is the so-called map matching. The goal of map matching is to infer the trajectory that the device followed in a road network from a potentially sparse series of noisy location measurements. Although accurate and robust map matching algorithms based on probabilistic models exist, they are computationally heavy and thus impractical for processing of large datasets. In this paper, we present a scalable map-matching algorithm based on Dijkstra shortest path method, that is both accurate and applicable to large datasets. Our experiments on a publicly-available dataset showed that the proposed method achieves accuracy that is comparable to that of the existing map matching methods using only a fraction of computational resources. In result, our algorithm can be used to efficiently process large datasets of noisy and potentially sparse location data that would be unexploitable using existing techniques due to their high computational requirements.},

  abstract = {For solving problems from the domain of Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), we often need to connect vehicle plans into plans spanning longer time, a process we call plan chaining. As we show in this work, chaining of the plans can be used to reduce the size of MoD providers' fleet (fleet-sizing problem) but also to reduce the total driven distance by providing high-quality vehicle dispatching solutions in MoD systems. Recently, a solution that uses this principle has been proposed to solve the fleet-sizing problem. The method does not consider the time flexibility of the plans. Instead, plans are fixed in time and cannot be delayed. However, time flexibility is an essential property of all vehicle problems with time windows. This work presents a new plan chaining formulation that considers delays as allowed by the time windows and a solution method for solving it. Moreover, we prove that the proposed plan chaining method is optimal, and we analyze its complexity. Finally, we list some practical applications and perform a demonstration for one of them: a new heuristic vehicle dispatching method for solving the static dial-a-ride problem. The demonstration results show that our proposed method provides a better solution than the two heuristic baselines for the majority of instances that cannot be solved optimally. At the same time, our method does not have the largest computational time requirements compared to the baselines. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed optimal chaining method provides not only theoretically sound results but is also practically applicable.},
